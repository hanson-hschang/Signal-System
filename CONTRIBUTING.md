## ðŸš€ Developer Setup

### I. Prerequisites
This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast and reliable Python package management during development.
Install uv first:

```properties
# Install uv with pip
pip install uv
```

### II. Development Installation
Clone the repository and install with dev dependencies:
```properties
git clone https://github.com/hanson-hschang/pixelate.git
cd pixelate
uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
```

<details>

<summary>Detail of Development Installation</summary>

This installs the package in editable mode along with all development dependencies including testing, linting, formatting, and type checking tools.

**Development Tools:**
- pre-commit (git hooks)
- pyupgrade (syntax upgrades)
- pytest (testing framework)
- Ruff (linting and formatting)
- mypy (static type checking)
- bandit (security checking)

**Pre-commit Hooks:** Install pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits
```properties
# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

**Testing:** Use pytest for testing
```properties
# Run tests
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-branch -c pyproject.toml
```

**Linting and Formatting:** Use Ruff for linting and formatting
```properties
# Check for linting issues
uv run ruff check src tests
# Automatically fix linting issues
uv run ruff format src tests
uv run ruff check src tests --fix
```

**Type Checking:** Use mypy for static type checking
```properties
# Run static type checking
uv run mypy src tests
```

</details>

### III. Code Quality
- **Linting & Formatting**: Code is checked and formatted with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)
- **Type checking**: Static type checking with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/)
- **Security**: Security checks with [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/)

### IV. CI/CD
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration with separate workflows:
- **Test workflow**: Runs tests on Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- **Linting workflow**: Ensures code adheres to linting standards
- **Security workflow**: CodeQL security scanning with write permissions for security results
- All checks must pass before merging to main branch


### V. Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): short description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
